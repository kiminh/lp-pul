# Label Propagation for Positive and Unlabeled Learnind (LP-PUL)

Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PUL) uses unlabeled documents and a few positive documents, in which the user is interested in, for retrieving a set of "interest" documents from a text collection. Usually, PUL approaches are based on the vector space model. However, when dealing with semi-supervised learning for text classification or information retrieval, graph-based approaches have been proved to outperform vector space model-based approaches. So in this article is proposed a graph-based approach for PUL referred to as Label Propagation for Positive and Unlabeled Learning (LP-PUL). The proposed framework consists of three steps: (i) building a similarity graph, (ii) identifying reliable negative documents, and (iii) performing label propagation to classify the remaining unlabeled documents as positive or negative. We carried out evaluation to measure the impact of the different choices in each step of the proposed framework. We also demonstrated that the proposal surpasses the performance of other PUL algorithms in terms of the accuracy of the retrieved interest document set.
